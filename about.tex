\section{SLU's Day of Bioinformatics}
This symposium aims to bring together researchers, bioinformaticians and people interested in advances of agricultural sciences from all over SLU (and other places). 


\section{SLUBI}

Today's symposium is organized by SLUBI, SLU's Bioinformatics Infrastructure. SLUBI provides bioinformatics and data science support to SLU's researchers since 2017. We provide a wide spectrum of services, including hands-on assistance for bioinformatics analyses, basic and advanced training and consultation services. 

SLUBI is working in collaboration with NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden), SLU's Center for Statistics, as well as SLU's Data Management Center.
