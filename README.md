# SBD_booklet
This is the code for the booklet for SLU's Day of Bioinformatics in September 2023. 

The open-source LaTeX template, AMCOS_booklet, used to generate this booklet is available at https://github.com/maximelucas/AMCOS_booklet. 

How to use: 

Run LaTeX on MAIN.tex. This will create the symposium booklet with a 
-  cover (Cover_SLU.pdf)
-  table of contents (automatically created)
-  welcome text (about.tex)
-  time table (timetable.tex)
-  information about the venues (useful_info.tex)
-  and contact information (logos.tex)

Style definitions, colors etc are in (and can be adapted in) preamble*.tex.
